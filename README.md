The Travel Planner System is a software application designed to help users find the most optimal travel routes between multiple locations. It uses graph data structures, where locations are represented as nodes and travel routes as edges, with attributes such as distance, travel time, and cost. The system employs algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) to calculate and display the shortest and most efficient paths based on user preferences.

Users can input their starting point, destination, and preferences (distance, time, or cost) through a simple interface. The system computes the optimal route, highlights intermediate stops, and provides details about the total distance, time, and cost of the journey.

This application is particularly useful for navigation systems, logistics, and travel agencies, offering solutions to optimize routes for commuters, delivery services, or travelers. It also demonstrates practical applications of graph theory, enhancing the user's understanding of algorithms and data structures. The Travel Planner System combines robust functionality with ease of use, making it an indispensable tool for efficient travel planning.
